# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 18, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Started two simple Python projects, just to get going.

**Thoughts:** I’ve always longed for a perfect point in the time-space continuum to start. Anxiously looking at the smallest clock hand to strike the full hour but somehow missing the moment due to the smallest cracking of the floor or shadow of passerby outside of my window. Today I tried to sneak past the ritual, to stay in a blindspot of its omnipotent rule. Started to code in a small oddly shaped period of time, squished between vacuuming crevices of my house and being in a hurry. Then I held my breath for a few hours just to return in the evening. 
It was easier this way. Somehow it felt sacrilegious, but it started nonetheless.

### Day 2: March 19, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Continued my pomodoro app. Exlored Tkinter. Did some pixel art for fun. 

**Thoughts:** One hour of time has a great disadvantage of exposing one’s tardiness. Got frustrated with myself. Couldn’t start coding right away so I used playing with pixel art as a lure (it worked, in the end I’m a fish at heart). Made the evil tomato too small, now the whole app is too small, not that anybody cares. Will let it be for now.

### Day 3: March 20, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Added timer and different frames to pomodoro app.

**Thoughts:** Worked for well more than an hour without timing myself. Feeling tired and restless today, dissatisfied with what I managed to do today. Maybe it’s just my distaste for making user interfaces.

### Day 3: March 21, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Made Pomodoro app (mostly) functional: added option to add and delete allowed apps, made a timer gimmick work. 

**Thoughts:** Possibly today it was a day that a coding habit started to take root. I came back home with no desire to code and disgruntled that I have to continue working on a dreaded interface. But I sat down at my computer anyway and from there it was surprisingly easy. There were a few obstacles along the way but as for now this app is mostly functional. I hope to finish it by tomorrow and finally move on to something that doesn’t require me putting a button anywhere on a screen.

### Day 4: March 22, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Added a pause/unpause and stop buttons, improved timer.

**Thoughts:** Didn’t feel like having thoughts important enough to write down. Coded nonetheless.

### Day 5: March 23, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the interface

**Thoughts:** Interface frustrated me immensely, but it’s a lesson in humility. Didn’t want to journal today either.

### Day 6: March 24, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Pomodoro App!

**Thoughts:** Finally finished this pomodoro app. I’m very satisfied with how it turned out although I’ve spent too much time dwelling on the buttons and text side of things. It’s not my cup of tea but it would be ridiculous for me to just skip GUI altogether. Taught me a valuable lesson that I feel much more at home in data analysis and backend than the frontend.

### Day 7: March 25, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Picked up writing speed script, added listening for keyboard. 

**Thoughts:** After finishing the pomodoro app (I used it today and the fact that it counts working time only when I have Visual Studio Code on top is diabolical) it was time to return to writing speed project. To be honest I’ve spent a lot of time just looking at the screen and wondering how I should go about that. I also realised that while I knew how I would do some things in R I have no idea how to deal with the same data in Pandas. It made me think of putting more time into upkeep my R skills. I have a heartbreaking habit of putting things aside, for reasons usually connected to motivation, and realizing a few years down the line that if I cultivated that habit it would be fruitful by now.

### Day 8: March 26, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Did writing speed per minute aggregating function and worked on exercises for neuroscience ML.

**Thoughts:** Today seemed to be off to a good start. I woke up at 7am to do some work on my ML class materials. Sadly I wasn’t awake enough to notice I didn’t save it and just turned my computer off. My grave mistake became apparent only during the aforementioned class. While I could wallow in my own misery of wasting my time (as if I’m not wasteful in other ways), I’ve just redid it. Even put in some more effort just to render the report from Quarto that I used before only in the context of RStudio. 
After dwelling in front of the screen for so long today it was tempting to just count ML class towards my daily coding goal. But I did not (entirely). Instead I did some small improvements on my writing speed project as I really want it finished to use it.
