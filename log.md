# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 18, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Started two simple Python projects, just to get going.

**Thoughts:** I’ve always longed for a perfect point in the time-space continuum to start. Anxiously looking at the smallest clock hand to strike the full hour but somehow missing the moment due to the smallest cracking of the floor or shadow of passerby outside of my window. Today I tried to sneak past the ritual, to stay in a blindspot of its omnipotent rule. Started to code in a small oddly shaped period of time, squished between vacuuming crevices of my house and being in a hurry. Then I held my breath for a few hours just to return in the evening. 
It was easier this way. Somehow it felt sacrilegious, but it started nonetheless.

### Day 2: March 19, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Continued my pomodoro app. Exlored Tkinter. Did some pixel art for fun. 

**Thoughts:** One hour of time has a great disadvantage of exposing one’s tardiness. Got frustrated with myself. Couldn’t start coding right away so I used playing with pixel art as a lure (it worked, in the end I’m a fish at heart). Made the evil tomato too small, now the whole app is too small, not that anybody cares. Will let it be for now.

### Day 3: March 20, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Added timer and different frames to pomodoro app.

**Thoughts:** Worked for well more than an hour without timing myself. Feeling tired and restless today, dissatisfied with what I managed to do today. Maybe it’s just my distaste for making user interfaces.
