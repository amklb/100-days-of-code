# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 18, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Started two simple Python projects, just to get going.

**Thoughts:** I’ve always longed for a perfect point in the time-space continuum to start. Anxiously looking at the smallest clock hand to strike the full hour but somehow missing the moment due to the smallest cracking of the floor or shadow of passerby outside of my window. Today I tried to sneak past the ritual, to stay in a blindspot of its omnipotent rule. Started to code in a small oddly shaped period of time, squished between vacuuming crevices of my house and being in a hurry. Then I held my breath for a few hours just to return in the evening. 
It was easier this way. Somehow it felt sacrilegious, but it started nonetheless.

### Day 2: March 19, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Continued my pomodoro app. Exlored Tkinter. Did some pixel art for fun. 

**Thoughts:** One hour of time has a great disadvantage of exposing one’s tardiness. Got frustrated with myself. Couldn’t start coding right away so I used playing with pixel art as a lure (it worked, in the end I’m a fish at heart). Made the evil tomato too small, now the whole app is too small, not that anybody cares. Will let it be for now.

### Day 3: March 20, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Added timer and different frames to pomodoro app.

**Thoughts:** Worked for well more than an hour without timing myself. Feeling tired and restless today, dissatisfied with what I managed to do today. Maybe it’s just my distaste for making user interfaces.

### Day 3: March 21, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Made Pomodoro app (mostly) functional: added option to add and delete allowed apps, made a timer gimmick work. 

**Thoughts:** Possibly today it was a day that a coding habit started to take root. I came back home with no desire to code and disgruntled that I have to continue working on a dreaded interface. But I sat down at my computer anyway and from there it was surprisingly easy. There were a few obstacles along the way but as for now this app is mostly functional. I hope to finish it by tomorrow and finally move on to something that doesn’t require me putting a button anywhere on a screen.

### Day 4: March 22, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Added a pause/unpause and stop buttons, improved timer.

**Thoughts:** Didn’t feel like having thoughts important enough to write down. Coded nonetheless.

### Day 5: March 23, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the interface

**Thoughts:** Interface frustrated me immensely, but it’s a lesson in humility. Didn’t want to journal today either.

### Day 6: March 24, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Pomodoro App!

**Thoughts:** Finally finished this pomodoro app. I’m very satisfied with how it turned out although I’ve spent too much time dwelling on the buttons and text side of things. It’s not my cup of tea but it would be ridiculous for me to just skip GUI altogether. Taught me a valuable lesson that I feel much more at home in data analysis and backend than the frontend.
