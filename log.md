# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 18, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Started two simple Python projects, just to get going.

**Thoughts:** Iâ€™ve always longed for a perfect point in the time-space continuum to start. Anxiously looking at the smallest clock hand to strike the full hour but somehow missing the moment due to the smallest cracking of the floor or shadow of passerby outside of my window. Today I tried to sneak past the ritual, to stay in a blindspot of its omnipotent rule. Started to code in a small oddly shaped period of time, squished between vacuuming crevices of my house and being in a hurry. Then I held my breath for a few hours just to return in the evening. 
It was easier this way but somehow it felt sacrilegious, but it started nonetheless.
